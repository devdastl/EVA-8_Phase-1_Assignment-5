# EVA-8_Phase-1_Assignment-5
This is the assignment of 5th session in phase-1 of EVA-8 from TSAI.

## Introduction

### Objective
Objective of this assignment is to build three CNN based network which will take [MNIST Handwritten Dataset](<http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>) and should have following properties.
1. This three networks should be following:
    - First network using Batch Normalization and L1 regularization.
    - Second network using Group Normalization
    - Third network using Layer Normalization.
2. We should have single model.py file which will contain model architecture defination as well as way to select from above mentioned normalization.
3. There should be a single notebook which will call this components and each model will be trained for 20epoch.
4. Graphs generated by the model as well as 10 misclassified images from each model.

### Repository setup
Since all the essential modules are written in .py files which are then getting called in main notebook, it is necessary to understand the structure of the repository.
Below is a quick look on how the repository is setup:

```
### Getting started
To get started with the repo is really easy. Follow below steps to run everything by your self:
1. Open main notebook `EVA-8_Phase-1_Assignment-5.ipynb` and click on "open with cloab" option.
2. Run the first cell. This cell will git clone this repo so that all fucntions are available in your runtime.
3. That's it! Now you can execute the cell and train this three models. Other detials are commented in the main notebook.
